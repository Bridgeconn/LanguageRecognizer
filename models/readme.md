# Language Dectection Models

Each model here will be named with the experiment number and the script it is trained for. The experiment number should correspond to the one mentioned in  (notes)[./docs/Experiment_notesmd]. 

Need not commit the model files to git during the experiment phase. Once the development mode starts, the models to be used in production can be commited to git repo if needed.
